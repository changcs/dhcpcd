dhcpcd (1:3.2.3-11+deb7u1) oldstable-security; urgency=high

  * Fix CVE-2012-6698, CVE-2012-6699, CVE-2012-6700,
    out-of-bound reads/writes and use-after-free issues with specially
    crafted DHCP messages.
    This is a forward port of the patch applied to squeeze-lts since
    wheezy uses the same upstream version. (LP: #1517226)

dhcpcd (1:2.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    * New upstream: the previous upstream maintainer went MIA, so the
      2.x.x series is a fork. It merges everthing relevant from the Debian
      and Gentoo packages. From the Debian point of view, the changes 
      are therefore the things imported from Gentoo. These are the 
      -F -e and -m options.

    * Add a comment to /etc/dhcpc/config in attempt to avoid confusion
      over which interface it applies to. (closes: #311495)
    * Fix the value of the "Maximum message size" option. This value
      includes the IP and UDP headers, and it's minium value is therefore
      576, according to RFC2131.	
    * Fix a security hole. A malformed DHCP packet could crash dhcpcd.

    * Don't exit with an error when calling dhcpcd -k and the process

      an infinite lease and exited. Returning an error stops ifdown from
      taking the interface down in that case. (closes  #258641)

dhcpcd (1:1.3.22pl1-4) unstable; urgency=high

    * Removed shopt command from preinst - not required (closes: #153452)
    * Added code to automatically copy enough configuration
      on upgrade to keep the machine on the net. (closes: #153293)
      Detailed change as follows.
      1) No longer stop existing daemon in preinst, instead copy config file
         for use in postinst.
      2) In postinst update /etc/network/interfaces, then stop old daemon, 
         then run ifup on the interface.
      3) Change depends to pre-depends on ifupdown, since it has to be
         functional for the above to work.

dhcpcd (1:1.3.22pl1-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
    * New maintainer.
    * New upstream. (closes:143657) (closes:143660)
    * Removed /etc/init.d/dhcpcd. dhcpcd is now started by ifup or the pcmcia
      package. This is corresponds with the mechanism used by pump.
      (closes:140288) (closes:127773) (closes:118039) (closes:121208)
    * Removed kernel 2.0.x support since debian now longer supports this
      kernel series. The latest upstream now allows compilation for
      2.0.x anyway, so the ancient and unsupported 0.70 source tree has gone
      as well. 2.0.x users can recompile the source package.
    * Added a wrapper (/sbin/dhcpcd) around the real binary (/sbin/dhcpcd-bin)
      which allows options to be set in /etc/dhcpc/config. ifup allows
      most common options to be set, but not some which may be useful, 
      and dhcpcd doesn't natively support a config file.
    * Do not allow dhcpcd to alter /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/ntp.conf or
      /etc/yp.conf by default: these all need settings in 
      /etc/dhcpc/config now. /etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf is still supported
      for dnsmasq.
    * Removed strange diversion of /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/ntp.conf
      via symlinks.
    * Patched upstream to remove security hole associated with shell
      metachars in dhcpcd-<interface>.info. Without the patch talking to
      a DHCP server which returned a domain name of eg `rm -rf /` would
      cause big problems!
